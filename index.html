<p>Widely held to be true by many sports fans, the "hot hand" theory is the belief that a person who has experienced success with a seemingly random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts. In the context of basketball, this is the belief that as a player continuously makes successful, sequential shots (i.e. when they're on a streak), their next shot has a higher chance of success than if they were not on a streak. Most studies in the past have shown that the hot hand theory is fallacious; however, a recent study has provided some convincing evidence that the hot hand theory might not be so far-fetched after all. The goal of our project is to see for ourselves if the hot hand theory is in fact merely a falsehood. </p>

<p>A statistical model of the hot hand might look something like </p>

<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5vpYa.png" alt="Logistic Function"></p>

<p>Depicted above is a logistic regression classifier that predicts a binary outcome (1 or 0 or in the case of the hot hand, shot made or missed) given some predictor. In the case of the hot hand, that predictor (the variable along the x axis) is the shooter’s previous streak. If the logistic regression predicts that the probability of making a shot increases as the player’s streak increases, this indicates the player has the hot hand.</p>
