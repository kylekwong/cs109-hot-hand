  "body": "# Motivation\r\nWidely held to be true by many sports fans, the \"hot hand\" theory is the belief that a person who has experienced success with a seemingly random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts. In the context of basketball, this is the belief that as a player continuously makes successful, sequential shots (i.e. when they're on a streak), their next shot has a higher chance of success than if they were not on a streak. Most studies in the past have shown that the hot hand theory is fallacious; however, a recent study has provided some convincing evidence that the hot hand theory might not be so far-fetched after all. The goal of our project is to see for ourselves if the hot hand theory is in fact merely a falsehood. \r\n\r\n# How the Hot Hand would Look\r\nA statistical model of the hot hand might look something like \r\n\r\n![Logistic Function](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/visuals/positive%20logit%20model.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nDepicted above is a logistic regression classifier that predicts a binary outcome (1 or 0 or in the case of the hot hand, shot made or missed) given some predictor. In the case of the hot hand, that predictor (the variable along the x axis) is the shooter’s previous streak. If the logistic regression predicts that the probability of making a shot increases as the player’s streak increases, this indicates the player has the hot hand.\r\n\r\n# Methods\r\nWe extract publicly available shot data from the 2013-14 NBA season containing information on the game, player, and other factors in which the shot occurred. From this data, we are able to construct a previous streak metric which will serve as our primary predictor in our analysis. The previous streak (`PreviousStreak` and `previous_streak`, used interchangeably) metric is equal to the number of shots made in a row (or missed in a row) prior to the shot in question. For consecutive misses, the value of the previous streak variable is negative.\r\n\r\nWe then fit a logistic regression model:\r\n\r\n![model equation](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/visuals/equation.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nwhere X<sub>s</sub> represents a vector of shot information including shot distance, closest defender’s distance, shooter’s overall field goal percentage, shot clock, final margin of the game, amongst other predictors. β<sub>1</sub> represents the hot hand effects, i.e. the increase in probability of making a shot for each addition to a player’s streak.\r\n\r\n# Results\r\n\r\n## NBA-Wide\r\n\r\n### Single Predictor Model\r\nThe baseline logistic regression model on the entire dataset returns a very small coefficient and one that is insignificant with a large standard error as you can see in the below output.\r\n\r\n![Logit Model with 1 Predictor](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/visuals/SpecificLogitModel.JPG?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe above figures demonstrate how difficult it is to build a useful model with only the `previous_streak` variable. The image displays the logit model and how it would predict whether a shot was made or not depending on the current value of `previous_streak`. If `previous_streak` had a strong correlation with whether the shot was made or not, then the line would have a more dramatic slope. If anything, the line has a negative slope contrary to our expectations about the hot hand effect. This model is only able to correctly classify **54.6%** of a test set of shots, which is barely better than flipping a coin. \r\n\r\n![Streak Distribution](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/website%20reports/streak_distributions.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe histogram figures displays the distribution of the `previous_streak` variable depending on whether the shot was missed or made. The distributions appear to be almost identical whether the shot is missed or made with the quantity of shots missed being greater than the amount made at about each value of `previous_streak`.\r\n\r\nIf `previous_streak` were more likely to be associated with a made shot, then we would see the made distribution more shifted to the right and the missed distribution more shifted to the left in the above figure, but this is obviously not the case and is what is driving the above results in the baseline model.\r\n\r\n### A more robust model\r\n![Logit Model as number of predictors increases](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/visuals/class%20rate%20versus%20predictors.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\nAdding in more predictors improves both the model's accuracy as well as the significance of the `previous_streak` variable (regression results displayed below). This model implies that for an increase in streak of one unit, this only affects the probability of making the next shot by about or less than 1%. Furthermore, this effect on probability is a decrease, i.e. the exact opposite of what we expect to see if the hot hand were true. If anything, a shooter on a streak becomes less likely to make their next shot. These results remain similar if we restrict the `previous_streak` variable to just positive values.\r\n\r\nAs we add more predictors, the classification rate improves with the biggest jump due to the addition of the shot distance variable. The predictors we decided to use can be seen below the figure.\r\n\r\n## Player by Player\r\n![Shots Taken vs. Distance Variance](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/visuals/STDvsShots.JPG?raw=true)\r\n\r\nWe chose to analyze players who take many shots and have a high distance variance. We did this to avoid picking players who only go for layups or players who only take three-point shots, and we chose to pick players who take more shots because players with more shots have a higher chance of being on a streak. \r\n\r\n![Top 20 Players](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/visuals/Top20Players%20Model%20Values.JPG?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThe top 20 players are listed above. We fit our robust hot hand model to each and list the model parameters and performance.\r\n\r\n![20 Players Analysis](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/website%20reports/player_coefficients.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n**The hot hand effect varies for our top 20 players.** If we fit models for individual players, the hot hand effect varies in both magnitude and sign. There is about an equal distribution of negative and positive estimated coefficients which resonates with our finding that the streak metric is generally an estimated zero when the model is run on the whole dataset. These are visualized in graphical and tabular images below.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of these estimates have p-values greater than .05 or .1 indicating that our estimates are not significant. Interestingly enough though is that the only player to have a significant estimate is Steph Curry (likely because he takes a large amount of shots). Steph's hot hand effect is estimated to be a negative coefficient though that implies as Steph makes an additional shot in a streak, his probability of making the next shot decreases by about 8% (which is pretty significant in magnitude). The player with the largest positive hot hand effect is Derrick Rose whose probability of making the next shot increases by about 5% for each additional shot he makes in a streak.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is important to consider multiple hypothesis testing as we create separate models for each player. Because the player's estimates are likely independent, we can choose our cut off value of significance as `.05/20 = 0.00256`. This would imply that none of our estimates are significant. In the future, it may be useful to have data on players from multiple seasons and with additional observations, we may gain greater statistical precision.\r\n\r\n### Testing Binary Heat\r\nIn order to further test the hot hand theory, we decided to run our regression using binary-encoded variables for streak instead of the previous_streak variable. We believed that this would examine the possibility that when a player is hot, it doesn't matter \"how hot\" he is (i.e. how long his streak is), but rather simply if he is hot or not. \r\n\r\nThree different binary variables were tested. \"Hot 2\" was an indicator of whether or not that player's previous streak was greater than or equal to 2. \"Hot 3\" was an indicator of whether or not the previous streak was greater than or equal to 3, and \"Hot 4\" was an indicator of whether or not the previous streak was greater than or equal to 4.\r\n\r\nThe results of this regression can be found in the table below. The columns for each variable name contain the coefficient calculated by our regression, and the column next to each variable (labeled p-Value#) is the corresponding p-value to the coefficient in the column to its left. Once again, due to multiple comparison's and a lower threshold for statistical significance, none of the players were found to have a statistically significant coefficient on any of the binary streak methods, further proving that the hot-hand is indeed dead.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# create lists for each new heat variable\r\nhot2 = []\r\nhot3 = []\r\nhot4 = []\r\n\r\n# fill each list with correct indicator\r\n# 1 for hot, 0 for not\r\nfor index, row in data.iterrows():\r\n  if row['previous_streak'] >= 2):\r\n    hot2.append(1)\r\n  else:\r\n    hot2.append(0)\r\n\r\nfor index, row in data.iterrows():\r\n  if row['previous_streak'] >= 3:\r\n    hot3.append(1)\r\n  else:\r\n    hot3.append(0)\r\n\r\nfor index, row in data.iterrows():\r\n  if row['previous_streak'] >= 4:\r\n    hot4.append(1)\r\n  else:\r\n    hot4.append(0)\r\n\r\n# create new columns\r\ndata['hot2] = hot2\r\ndata['hot3] = hot3\r\ndata['hot4] = hot4\r\n```\r\n\r\n![Binary Heat Table](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109-hot-hand/blob/master/visuals/binary_heat.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\nProject by Toni Divic (@tonidivic), Kyle Kwong (@kylekwong), Thomas O'Shea (@thomasoshea), and Charles Weber (@rubbadubcdub).",
