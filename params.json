  "body": "## Motivation\r\nWidely held to be true by many sports fans, the \"hot hand\" theory is the belief that a person who has experienced success with a seemingly random event has a greater chance of further success in additional attempts. In the context of basketball, this is the belief that as a player continuously makes successful, sequential shots (i.e. when they're on a streak), their next shot has a higher chance of success than if they were not on a streak. Most studies in the past have shown that the hot hand theory is fallacious; however, a recent study has provided some convincing evidence that the hot hand theory might not be so far-fetched after all. The goal of our project is to see for ourselves if the hot hand theory is in fact merely a falsehood. \r\n\r\n## How the Hot Hand would Look\r\nA statistical model of the hot hand might look something like \r\n\r\n<center>\r\n![Logistic Function](https://github.com/kylekwong/cs109_hot_hand/blob/master/visuals/positive%20logit%20model.png?raw=true)\r\n</center>\r\n\r\nDepicted above is a logistic regression classifier that predicts a binary outcome (1 or 0 or in the case of the hot hand, shot made or missed) given some predictor. In the case of the hot hand, that predictor (the variable along the x axis) is the shooter’s previous streak. If the logistic regression predicts that the probability of making a shot increases as the player’s streak increases, this indicates the player has the hot hand.\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\nWe extract publicly available shot data from the 2013-14 NBA season containing information on the game, player, and other factors in which the shot occurred. From this data, we are able to construct a previous streak metric which will serve as our primary predictor in our analysis. We then fit a logistic regression model:\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n![model equation](http://mathurl.com/gm6h7cn.png)\r\n</center>\r\n\r\nwhere X<sub>s</sub> represents a vector of shot information including shot distance, closest defender’s distance, shooter’s overall field goal percentage, shot clock, final margin of the game, amongst other predictors. β<sub>1</sub> represents the hot hand effects, i.e. the increase in probability of making a shot for each addition to a player’s streak.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nProject by Toni Divic (@tonidivic), Kyle Kwong (@kylekwong), Thomas O'Shea (@thomasoshea), and Charles Weber (@rubbadubcdub).",
